Place processed matrices needed by the analysis scripts here.

Typical files (download manually from GEO and rename if needed):
- `HU-HSA-cells.tsv`          — counts matrix for HU HSA cell lines (genes × samples; first column = GeneID)
- `GeneCounts.tsv`            — counts matrix for the public cohort (genes × samples; same GeneIDs)
- (optional) other matrices used in your manuscript figures

This folder is git-ignored in `.gitignore`.
